The goal of this exercise is to see if high-momentum stocks beat low-momentum stocks on average.  

Using the data from the SQL database, sort stocks each month into deciles based on 12-month momentum (mom12m), compute the return of each decile portfolio each month, and average the returns of the decile portfolios across months.   

Submit your Jupyter notebook to Canvas.
