Fit a random forest to the 2021-01 data using roeq, mom12m, and bm (book-to-market) as the predictors.  Use ret as the target variable (rather than rnk).  Set max_depth=4. Compute the in-sample $R^2$ as model.score(X,y).

Submit a Jupyter notebook to Ccanvas that contains your code and shows the $R^2$.
