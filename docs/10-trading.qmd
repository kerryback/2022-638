## Evolution of a long portfolio

- Select desired number of stocks.  Plan to equally weight (for example).
- Initially rank stocks.  Buy appropriate number of shares of top stocks.
- Spreadsheet 0: ranks, current prices, number of shares to buy
- Monitor:
  - Prices changed.  No longer equally weighted.
  - Ranks changed.  No longer holding just top stocks.
  - What trades to make?

## Toy example

- 5 stocks.  Initially invest ~20% in each.  Small cash balance.
- Monitor:
  - Spreadsheet 1: # shares, current price, market values of positions
  - Plus cash balance is current portfolio value
  - Spreadsheet 2: new ranks

## First decision: what to sell

- Sell all shares if new rank is too low
- Sell some shares if new weight is too high
- Maybe sell some shares if new rank is low but not too low?

## Second decision: what to buy

- Selling shares raises cash.  Plus prior cash balance.
- Want to invest all cash.
- Start with best stocks based on new ranking
  - If not holding, invest to 20%
  - If holding and weight < 20%, buy additional shares?
