Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\nMany new and rich data sources are being employed by equity managers. This course provides an introduction to evaluating and employing data in equity management. We donâ€™t have access to, for example, satellite or drone imagery or phone location data, but we do have access to data that has been shown to be useful, including past prices, corporate fundamentals, earnings announcements, analyst forecast revisions, etc. We will analyze this data on panels containing thousands of stocks over multiple years. We will train models, devise portfolio strategies based on model predictions, and backtest the strategies.\nWe will use python throughout the course. There are no programming prerequisites, and proficiency in programming is not at all expected. Code snippets will be provided that can be modified and used for assignments.\nThe course deliverables are weekly individual assignments and a final group project. There will be no final exam. The weekly assignments are small assignments intended to ensure that everyone is keeping up. They will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis. The group project is to train and evaluate a stock prediction model and deliver a write-up of the steps that were taken to evaluate and test the chosen model and alternate models.\n\n\n\n\nClassification with decision trees\n\nEvaluation: recall, precision, ROC curves, confusion matrices\nTrain and test\nComplexity and overfitting\n\nRegression with decision trees\n\nOptimization criteria\nRegularizing the target variable\n\nRandom forests and adaptive boosting\n\nHyperparameters and cross-validation\n\nNeural networks\n\nMLPs\nRegularizing predictors\n\nPipelines\nSQL via python\n\nReading from a SQL database\nCreating your own SQL database\n\nPenalized linear models\nVisualizing feature importance\nCreating and deploying machine learning apps with python\n\n\n\n\nEach year, the Chicago Quantitative Alliance (CQA) hosts a competition for universities on quantitative investing - the CQA Challenge. In 2021-2022, a team of JGSB MBA students won it, finishing first among 40 or so teams. The competition is to run a diversified long-short market neutral portfolio with a quantitative approach. Paper trading is done using the StockTrak platform. Teams are judged on compliance, returns, and a video presentation of their strategy in three stages: teams that perform well on compliance proceed to the second stage, the top ten teams on compliance and portfolio returns proceed to the third stage, and teams in the third stage prepare video presentations.\nThe machine learning techniques covered in this course can be and are used as the backbones of quantitative investment strategies, so this course should prepare you to participate in the competition if you are interested. A team is limited to five persons, but Rice can enter multiple teams, so there is no limit on participation. The competition begins in the first part of November. The start date is a little early relative to the timing of our courses, but you could use a generic strategy initially and then later trade into a strategy that you have optimized and tested. The contest lasts until the first of April, and participation entails a commitment until then. Access to a SQL database with daily updates of returns and financial reports will be provided to participants.\nThere will be a 3-credit-hour full semester course in the spring called Quantitative Investments Lab. Those participating in the CQA competition will find the course to be of assistance, but participation in the competition is not a prerequisite for taking the course. The course will provide additional hands-on training in models to predict returns and construct portfolios, and it will also cover practical issues that arise in the management of investment strategies, including managing turnover, estimating tracking errors, and evaluating performance.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other. Likewise, groups must do their projects, but they can seek advice from students in other groups. Also, searching for advice on the internet is allowed.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center."
