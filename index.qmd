#### Course Description   

Many new data sources are being employed by equity managers.  This course provides an introduction to evaluating and employing data in quantitative equity management.  Quantitative management means trading on quantitative signals that can be constructed and tested on large stock panels.  We don't have access to, for example, satellite or drone imagery or phone location data, but we do have access to data that has been shown to be useful, including past prices, corporate fundamentals, earnings announcements, analyst forecast revisions, etc.  We will analyze this data on panels containing thousands of stocks over multiple years.  We will train models, devise portfolio strategies based on model predictions, and backtest the strategies.

We will use python throughout the course.  There are no programming prerequisites, and proficiency in programming is not at all expected.  Code snippets will be provided that can be modified and used for assignments.  We will explore different machine learning models for return prediction.  In python, this is almost "point and click" -- three short lines of code will define a model, train a model, and predict using a model.


#### Course Topics

1. Constructing price signals: moving averages, relative strength index, etc.
2. Evaluating signals with sorts and regressions
3. Training, validating, and testing machine learning models
4. Portfolio strategies: when to trade on signals
5. Backtesting strategies
6. Industry sectors: to trade or not to trade?
7. Using corporate fundamental data


#### Grading

The course deliverables are five weekly individual assignments and a group project due the last day of class (Dec 5).  The individual assignments are small assignments intended to ensure that everyone is keeping up.  The group project is to train and evaluate a stock prediction model, deliver a write-up of the steps that were taken to evaluate and test the chosen model and alternate models, and make a presentation to the class.

Each of the individual assignments will contribute 10% of the final course grade.  The group project will contribute 40%, and group peer evaluations will contribute 10%.

The assignment due dates are

- Monday, Oct. 31
- Monday, Nov. 7
- Monday, Nov 14
- Monday, Nov 21
- Wednesday, Nov 30


#### Data-Driven Investments Sequence

This course is part of a new JGSB sequence.  *Data-Driven Investments: Credit* (Prof. Dittmar) will be offered in Spring Term 1, and *Data Driven Investments Lab* (Profs. Back and Crotty) will be offered as a full-semester spring course.  This course (Equity) and the Credit courses are self-contained, but there are obvious synergies.  The Lab course requires
either the Equity course or the Credit course as a pre/co-requisite.  The Lab course will involve students working in groups to explore other data sources and to further elaborate and test strategies.  The plan is that, in the second half of the course, equity strategies will be implemented with paper trading at Alpaca, which is a brokerage with a free python API.

#### CQA Competition

Each year, the Chicago Quantitative Alliance (CQA) hosts a competition for universities on quantitative investing - the [CQA Challenge](https://www.cqa.org/investment_challenge).  In 2021-2022, a team of [JGSB MBA students won it](https://www.cqa.org/past_challenges), finishing first among 40 or so teams.  The competition is to run a diversified long-short market-neutral portfolio with a quantitative approach.  Paper trading is done using the StockTrak platform.  Teams are judged on compliance, returns, and a video presentation of their strategy in three stages: teams that perform well on compliance proceed to the second stage, the top ten teams on compliance and portfolio returns proceed to the third stage, and teams in the third stage prepare video presentations.  

If a group participates in the CQA competition, then they can work as a group in the *Data-Driven Investments Lab* course, and the project in that course can be configured to support participation in the competition.  A team in the CQA competition is limited to five persons, but Rice can enter up to three teams.  The competition begins in the first part of November.  The start date is a little early relative to the timing of our courses, but you could use a generic strategy initially and then later trade into a strategy that you have optimized and tested.  The contest lasts until the first of April, and participation entails a commitment until then.  


#### Honor Code

The Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course.  Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other.  Likewise, groups must do their projects, but they can seek advice from students in other groups.  Also, searching for advice on the internet is allowed.


#### Disability Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to
contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations
regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities
should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center.
